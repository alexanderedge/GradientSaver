# Gradient Saver
A simple gradient screensaver for OS X.

The structure of this project is based on Sam Soffes' [clock-saver](https://github.com/soffes/clock-saver).

## Installation
Forthcoming

## Notes
Sometimes the screensaver shows as 'incompatible' with OS X. I've narrowed it down to being Swift-related and for some reason works when `ConfigureWindowController.swift` is not added to the target ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
